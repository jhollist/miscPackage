#miscPackage
A package of some functions I wrote and like to use.  As they don't really (yet) have a home in any standalone package they are here.

#Install the Package
To install the package and gain access to the materials do the following:
```
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
install_github("miscPackage","jhollist")
library("miscPackage")
```
